Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection.

In this project, We use the Irish Covid Data to implement 2 Bayesian Models with the Logistic Function yt - Po(lambdal(t)) and g(t) = theta1 exp(-theta2*theta3)^t.
The Bayesian models are then used to make predictions of future data. Finally the models are compared, using the available data to get the model which gives out the best predictions
